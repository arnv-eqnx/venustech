This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Overview
After receiving the task for screening test, I went on to the ioni website to look at it, get inspired by it and get those creative juices flowing. 

The website in and off itself is a minimal approach to a product. I myself am a hardcore fan of the minimalist astheic for websites but I believed that the ioni website could do better with some creative changes. I went section by section and had a brief idea about my approach to the redesign. I was going to combine the frosted glass-like texture with some minimal animations to give the website more appeal.

# Details

## Landing page
As you can see from my iteration of the website, as soon as the landing page is opened, I have implemented a glassmorphism design with frosted card elements. I have carried over the same lift up and color change animations for this section. The highlight of this page is the tag line with a color shifting linear gradient. This draws immediate attention to what th eproduct does and also, it looks cool in my opinion ;).

## Chatbot
Moving on to the next section where we give two of the main advantages of using ioni. The original website, though minimal, lacked subtle animations that are not too distracting and also convey what the message that is beign given. A simple animation like this "dialog to and fro" shows a potential user what the product does without even describing it with words. Other Moficiations to this section include basic (yet effective) box shadows.

## Call to Action
The next section also carries forward my design from the previous section. I have added an animation to show what is this section about and another animation that runs in teh background and will attract user attention.

## Join us
For the next section, i have opted for a glassmorph background witha shade of blue which induces a calming effect.  

## Connecting your data & Multilingual
For these sections as well, I had added animations that boost overall appeal of the website.

## Stats section
The stats section need to be big and bold. It has to draw utmost user attention and i have achieved this by adding a gradient to the text background. I have also added a futuristic / AI animation that also draws the focus to the said stats.

## Features
I believe this section of the website will either make or break the product. To make the section more intersting I changed the design again from minimal to glassmorph. The background and glass-textured cards are a unique UI element that I find pleasing. 

## How it works & Benefits
These sections of the website are a change again from the glassmorph to minimal. These sections show the information to the point. The creative decisions that I took here were to add a box shadow to create depth and add a subtle animation to draw user attention. The depth created by the box shadow also accentuates the animation.

## Use cases
This section shows the user the use cases that might require ioni as a product. The stark contrast between the background and the cards give this page a lot more appeal.

# Work to be done 
As someone who is currently working in another company, I was unable to put in enough hours into this exciting project. I have a few tasks remaining which I'd like to explain.

## Reviews section
This section will have a carousel crafted using framer motion that will provide a smooth and seamless UI experience
